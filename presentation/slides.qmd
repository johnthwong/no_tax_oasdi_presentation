# Agenda
1. The fundamental problem of retirement spending.
2. The impact of not taxing social security:
    - Fiscal.
    - Distributional.
    - Complexity. 
3. "Taxing payroll taxes" as a pay-for.
4. The issues of taxing payroll taxes:
    - Insufficient.
    - Distributionally worse.
    - Unintuitive. \pause
    
## Takeaways
1. Not taxing social security is fiscally bad.
2. Paying for it is distributionally bad.

# The fundamental problem of retirement spending
- The demographics makes the financing challenging.
- There are 2.7 working adults/elderly (SSA 2024). 
  - Down from a 3.2-3.4 historically. \pause
  - This is driven by both mediocre growth in the nominator and high growth in the denominator. \pause
- One way to see elderly population growth is to look at the fastest growing (not shares) of the federal expenditures over the next 30 years (CBO 2025).
  - Medicare: 385%
  - Social security: 241%.
  - Medicaid: 219%.
  - Rest of expenditures: 197%.

# Not taxing social security (benefits): what does it mean?
- Payroll "taxes" for social security and Medicare are **not** taxes, but rather contributions. 
  - And they are taken out of your paycheck pre-tax, i.e., before you are subject to income tax. \pause
  - So when you withdraw at old age as benefits, those get taxed. \pause
- So benefits are treated as income for taxation purposes, in the following manner:
  - Income tax is calculated on 50% of benefits, if total income is below $25,000.
    - This revenue goes to the Social Security trust fund. \pause
  - Income tax is calculated on 85% of benefits, if total income is above $25,000. 
    - The revenue generated from the additional 35% of benefits considered goes to the Medicare trust fund. \pause
- The fiscal implication is that a tax on social security benefits is that it reduces the net amount of retirement spending.
  - And alleviates the fundamental problem of retirement spending. \pause
- **Not taxing social security means setting both of those rates to zero.**

library(tidyverse)
score_1 = read.csv("scores/no_tax_on_oasdi.csv") %>%
  rename(
    "Savings (\\$bn)" = surplus
  )

gen_table <- function(df){
  knitr::kable(
    t(df),
    format = "latex",
    booktabs = TRUE,
    digits = 0,
    escape = FALSE
  ) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    font_size = 12, 
    latex_options = "hold_position",
    position = "left"
    )
}

gen_scores <- function(score){
  df = score %>% select("Savings (\\$bn)")
  rownames(df) = score$year
  
  df_1 <- df %>% slice(1:5)
  df_2 <- df %>% slice(6:11)
  print(gen_table(df_1))
  print(gen_table(df_2))
}

gen_scores(score_1)
```

The policy costs $1.3 trillion over ten years.

# Not taxing social security: impact on tax complextiy
- Not taxing social security will make taxes more complicated. \pause
- It's somewhat convoluted but bear with me: \pauses
  - For the tax bill to pass the Senate with 51 votes only, the Senate must undergo the "reconciliation" procedure. \pause
  - Senate rules forbid using reconciliation to change social security. \pause
  - Thus, any changes to the tax on social security benefits cannot be made by changing existing law's parameters. \pause
- Thus, any reduction of the elderly's tax burden must come from a separate credit that is calculated based the tax you are about to pay.
  - This design has been confirmed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Jason Smith. \pause
- In practice, this means when you do your taxes,
  - You have to first calculate how much taxes you owe on your social security benefits.
  - And then calculate how much credit you get based on the tax you owe.

# Potential solution: taxing payroll taxes
- Recall that the law considers the payroll taxes you pay to be contributions.\pause
- Half of contributions are paid for by employers. \pause
  - By that logic, employers' payroll taxes are actually extra income you're earning, that you immediately transfer into a retirement fund. \pause
  - And that income is currently untaxed. \pause
  - So we should add that amount to your amount of taxable income. \pause
- There are two combinations of policies proposed:
    1. Tax all employer payroll contributions as employee's additional income; exempt all social security benefits from taxation. \pause
    2. Tax only employer's *Medicare* payroll contributions as employee's additional income; \pause set only the additional share of benefits subject to tax, to 0% (recall that it's currently at 35%; revenue goes to Medicare fund).
    
# Fiscal impact

## Option 1 does lead to a surplus

```{r}
#| results: asis

score = read.csv("scores/crfb_reform_scores_all_fica.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    revenue = round(revenue/1e9, 1)
    ) %>%
  rename(
    "Savings (\\$bn)" = revenue
  ) 

score[11, "year"] = "Ten year"

gen_scores(score)
```
\pause

## Option 2 does not add up at all

```{r}
#| results: asis

score = read.csv("scores/crfb_reform_scores_medicare.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    revenue = round(revenue/1e9, 1)
    ) %>%
  rename(
    "Savings (\\$bn)" = revenue
  ) 

score[11, "year"] = "Ten year"

gen_scores(score)
```

- Redistribution accrues exclusively to the elderly, at the cost of poverty among workers and children. \pause
- Note that taxing payroll contributions is identical to a flat tax, so this distributional pattern is something that most revenue proposals will entail

# Is taxing payroll "contributions" sensible?

- When your pre-tax income is reduced by payroll contributions, does *anyone* think of it as saved income rather than as a tax? \pause
- Intuition fits accounting treatment:
    - In modeling, we treat any money going to the government as public revenue, not private savings. \pause
- Intuition fits reality:
    - The amount paid into social security and Medicare do not map one-to-one to how much you take out. \pause
    - In fact, the government has taken money out of the trust funds to finance general expenditures before, so the payroll contributions aren't really stored in a separate pot of money.
- So taxing payroll contributions will be very unintuitive to taxpayers, to say the least.
    
# Is taxing social security benefits sensible in the first place?
- I must admit this is probably why a tax on social security benefits is so odd. \pause 
- Intuitively and economically, government payments are part of the tax-and-transfer system, and therefore *post-tax*. \pause
  - But the law treats this class of payment as pre-tax, which clashes with intuition and output accounting. \pause
- Instead of paying people a benefit and then taking it away, I think it's simpler and more honest to just reduce the benefit paid upfront.

# Conclusion
- Just removing the tax and not reducing the gross benefit is worse than the current regime for fiscal reasons. \pause
  - Refunding people after they pay the tax, after you pay them the benefit, is even worse, for fiscal and complexity reasons! \pause
- Removing the tax and taxing workers more is fiscally better but worse for age-distributional and complexity reasons.
