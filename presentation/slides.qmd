# Agenda
1. The fundamental problem of retirement spending.
2. How is social security taxed.
3. The impact of not taxing social security:
    - Fiscal.
    - Distributional.
4. How does "taxing payroll taxes" work.
5. The issues of taxing payroll taxes:
    - Fiscal.
    - Distributional.
    - Intuitiveness. \pause
    
## Takeaways
1. Not taxing social security is fiscally bad.
2. Paying for it is distributionally bad.

# The fundamental problem of retirement spending
- The demographics makes the financing challenging.
- There are 2.7 working adults/elderly (SSA 2024). 
  - Down from a 3.2-3.4 historically. \pause
- Another way to see elderly population growth is to look at the fastest growing (not shares) of the federal expenditures over the next 30 years (CBO 2025). \pause
  - Medicare: 385%
  - Social security: 241%.
  - Medicaid: 219%.
  - Rest of expenditures: 197%.

# Not taxing social security (benefits): what does it mean?
\pause
- We need to start with payroll "taxes" (for social security and Medicare), which are **not** taxes, but rather contributions. \pause
  - Technically, you contribute out of your paycheck pre-tax, i.e., before you are subject to income tax. \pause
  - So when you withdraw at old age as benefits, those get taxed. \pause
- Benefits are treated as income for taxation purposes, in the following manner:
  - Income tax is calculated on 50% of benefits, if total income is below $25,000.
    - This revenue goes to the Social Security trust fund. \pause
  - Income tax is calculated on 85% of benefits, if total income is above $25,000. 
    - The revenue generated from the additional 35% of benefits considered goes to the Medicare trust fund. \pause
- The fiscal implication is that a tax on social security benefits is that it reduces the net amount of retirement spending.
  - And alleviates the fundamental problem of retirement spending. \pause
- **Not taxing social security means setting both of those rates to zero.**

# Not taxing social security: fiscal impact

The following estimates from a simulation of the US economy with PolicyEngine, which: 
- Apply federal and state tax and benefit rules to representative samples of the population.
- Calculate outcomes for each household based on their unique characteristics.
- Aggregate results to estimate population-wide impacts.

    )
}

gen_scores <- function(score){
  df = score %>% select("Savings (\\$bn)")
  rownames(df) = score$year
  
  df_1 <- df %>% slice(1:5)
  df_2 <- df %>% slice(6:11)
  print(gen_table(df_1))
  print(gen_table(df_2))
}

gen_scores(score_1)
```

The policy costs $1.3 trillion over ten years.

# Potential solution: taxing payroll taxes
- To pay for not taxing social security benefits, some have suggested taxing payroll taxes instead. What does that mean? \pause
- Recall that the law considers the payroll taxes you pay to be contributions.
- Half of contributions are paid for by employers. \pause
  - By that logic, employers' payroll taxes are actually extra income you're earning, that you immediately transfer into a retirement fund. \pause
  - And that income is currently untaxed. \pause
  - So we should add that amount to your amount of taxable income. \pause
- There are two combinations of policies proposed:
    1. Tax all employer payroll contributions as employee's additional income; exempt all social security benefits from taxation. \pause
    2. Tax only employer's *Medicare* payroll contributions as employee's additional income; \pause set only the additional share of benefits subject to tax, to 0% (recall that it's currently at 35%; revenue goes to Medicare fund).
    
# Fiscal impact

## Option 1 does lead to a surplus

```{r}
#| results: asis

score = read.csv("scores/crfb_reform_scores_all_fica.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    revenue = round(revenue/1e9, 1)
    ) %>%
  rename(
    "Savings (\\$bn)" = revenue
  ) 

score[11, "year"] = "Ten year"

gen_scores(score)
```
\pause

## Option 2 does not add up at all

```{r}
#| results: asis

score = read.csv("scores/crfb_reform_scores_medicare.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    revenue = round(revenue/1e9, 1)
    ) %>%
  rename(
    "Savings (\\$bn)" = revenue
  ) 

score[11, "year"] = "Ten year"

gen_scores(score)
```

- Redistribution accrues exclusively to the elderly, at the cost of poverty among workers and children. \pause
- Note that taxing payroll contributions is identical to a flat tax, so this distributional pattern is something that most revenue proposals will entail

# Is taxing payroll "contributions" consistent with intuition?

- When your pre-tax income is reduced by payroll contributions, do you think of it as saved income rather than as a tax? \pause
- Intuition fits economic treatment:
    - In modeling, we treat any money going to the government as public revenue, not private savings. \pause
- Intuition fits reality:
    - The amount paid into social security and Medicare do not map one-to-one to how much you take out. \pause
    - In fact, the government has taken money out of the trust funds to finance general expenditures before, so the payroll contributions aren't really stored the same way like a retirement fund. \pause
- So I expect taxing payroll contributions will be very unintuitive to taxpayers, to say the least, if not very unpopular.
