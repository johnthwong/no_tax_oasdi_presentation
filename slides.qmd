## Agenda

1.  The fundamental problem of retirement spending.
2.  How social security is taxed.
3.  The impact of not taxing social security benefits.
    -   Fiscal.
    -   Distributional.
4.  A proposal to "tax payroll taxes" instead, explained.
5.  The impact of taxing payroll taxes.
    -   Fiscal.
    -   Distributional.\pause

### Takeaways

1.  Not taxing social security is fiscally bad.
2.  But paying for proposal is distributionally bad.

## The fundamental problem of retirement spending

-   The demographics makes the financing challenging.
-   There are 2.7 working adults/elderly (SSA 2024).
    -   Down from a 3.2 historically. \pause
    -   By 2040, it will be 2.4.
-   Another way to see elderly population growth is to look at projected growth (not shares) of major federal budget items over the next 30 years (CBO 2025). \pause
    -   Medicare: 5.4% per year.
    -   Social security: 4.2% per year.
    -   **Tax revenue: 4.1% per year.**
    -   Medicaid: 3.9% per year.
    -   Rest of expenditures: 3.7% per year. \pause
-   Any spending targeted at old age runs into the issue of runaway growth: this is the Fundamental Problem of Retirement Spending.

## Not taxing social security (benefits): what does it mean?

\pause

-   We need to start with payroll "taxes" (for social security and Medicare), which are **not** taxes, but rather contributions. \pause
    -   Technically, you contribute out of your paycheck pre-tax, i.e., before the deduction of income tax. \pause
    -   So when contributions become benefits at old age, those get taxed. \pause
-   Benefits are treated as income for taxation purposes, in the following manner:
    -   Income tax is calculated on **50%** of benefits, if total income is below \$25,000.
        -   This revenue goes to the Social Security trust fund. \pause
    -   Income tax is calculated on **additional 35%** of benefits, if total income is above \$25,000.
        -   The additional revenue goes to the Medicare trust fund. \pause
-   Understand that:
    1.  The fiscal implication is that a tax on social security benefits is that it reduces the net amount of retirement spending.
        -   Which alleviates the Fundamental Problem. \pause
    2.  Not taxing social security is equivalent setting both of those rates to zero.

## Not taxing social security: fiscal impact

The following estimates from a simulation of the US economy done with PolicyEngine, which:

-   Applies federal and state tax and benefit rules to representative samples of the population.
-   Calculates outcomes for each household based on their unique characteristics.
-   Aggregates results to estimate population-wide impacts.

#| results: asis

library(tidyverse)
score_1 = read.csv("scores/no_tax_on_oasdi.csv") %>%
  rename(
    "Savings (\\$bn)" = surplus
  )

gen_table <- function(df){
  knitr::kable(
    t(df),

    booktabs = TRUE,
    digits = 0,
    escape = FALSE

    position = "left"
    )
}

gen_scores <- function(score){
  df = score %>% select("Savings (\\$bn)")
  rownames(df) = score$year
  
  df_1 <- df %>% slice(1:5)
  df_2 <- df %>% slice(6:11)
  print(gen_table(df_1))
  print(gen_table(df_2))
}

gen_scores(score_1)
```

-   The policy costs roughly \$1.3 trillion over ten years. \pause
    -   Which will add 6 percent to the \$21 trillion of debt that the government is scheduled to borrow (over the coming decade).

\pause

-   How would you pay for it?

## Potential pay-for: taxing payroll taxes

-   To pay for "no tax on social security benefits", some have suggested taxing payroll taxes instead. What does that mean? \pause
-   Recall that the law considers the payroll taxes you pay to be contributions.
-   Half of contributions are paid for by employers. \pause
    -   By that logic, employers are funding your retirement and you're not getting taxed for this additional compensation. \pause
    -   So the idea is to add that amount to your amount of taxable income. \pause
-   There are two combinations of policies proposed:
    1.  Tax all employer payroll contributions as employee's additional income; exempt all social security benefits from taxation. \pause
    2.  Tax only employer's *Medicare* payroll contributions as employee's additional income; \pause set only the additional share of benefits subject to tax, to 0% (recall that it's currently at 35%, and that revenue goes to the Medicare fund).

## Tax payroll not benefits: fiscal impact

### Option 1 does lead to a surplus

```{r}
#| results: asis

score = read.csv("scores/crfb_reform_scores_all_fica.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    revenue = round(revenue/1e9, 1)
    ) %>%
  rename(
    "Savings (\\$bn)" = revenue
  ) 

score[11, "year"] = "Ten year"

gen_scores(score)
```

\pause

### Option 2 does not raise enough

```{r}
#| results: asis

score = read.csv("scores/crfb_reform_scores_medicare.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    revenue = round(revenue/1e9, 1)
    ) %>%
  rename(
    "Savings (\\$bn)" = revenue
  ) 

score[11, "year"] = "Ten year"

gen_scores(score)
```

\pause

-   Let's focus on Option 1 to see what raising revenue looks like.

-   Redistribution accrues exclusively to the elderly, at the cost of poverty among workers and children. \pause
-   Distributional pattern isn't unique to taxing payroll contributions, which is akin to a generic progressive tax.$^1$
    
\tiny $^1$This is because (a) payroll contributions/income is roughly the same rate regardless of income, and (b) the proposal would tax this amount as income, which is taxed progressively.

## Conclusion

-   Increasing the net benefits received by retirees, while imposing an additional tax burden on workers, exacerbates the Fundamental Problem of Retirement Spending. \pause
-   Increasing net benefits alone worsens the debt problem. \pause
-   The best policy is to reject "no tax on Social Security benefits" proposals and maintain current law.

# Appendix

## Is taxing payroll "contributions" consistent with intuition?

-   When your pre-tax income is reduced by payroll contributions, do you think of it as saved income rather than as a tax? \pause
-   Intuition fits economic treatment:
    -   In modeling, we treat any money going to the government as public revenue, not private savings. \pause
-   Intuition fits reality:
    -   The amount paid into social security and Medicare do not map one-to-one to how much you take out. \pause
    -   In fact, the government has taken money out of the trust funds to finance general expenditures before, so the payroll contributions aren't really stored the same way like a retirement fund. \pause
-   So I expect taxing payroll contributions will be very unintuitive to taxpayers, to say the least, if not very unpopular.
